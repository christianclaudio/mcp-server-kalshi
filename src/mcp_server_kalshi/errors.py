"""Credential redaction and the Kalshi API error.

Redaction follows the template v1.6.0 house rules: a quoted value is masked to its closing
quote, an unquoted credential value to the end of the line, a ``{...}``/``[...]``/``(...)``
value (also under a quoted Python ``repr`` key) to its balanced bracket, any PEM block
whole to the ``-----END`` with its own label, and any non-None value under a credential key,
whatever its type. JSON inside a message is parsed and redacted value by value
(``redact_message``/``redact_payload``) so it keeps its shape. The Kalshi-specific patterns
(``KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY``/``KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE`` headers, a ``Bearer`` value of any
length) run after the house rules; all fail closed. The house PEM rule matches labels in
any case and masks a ``-----BEGIN`` with no matching ``-----END`` to the end of the text,
in one linear pass. The mask is the fixed ``[REDACTED]``.
